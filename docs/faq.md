## Why is my browser not supported?

Weâ€™re using the [Web Cryptography JavaScript API with the AES-GCM
algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#aes-gcm) for our encryption.
Many browsers support this standard and should work fine, but some have not
implemented it yet (mobile browsers lag behind on this, in
particular).

## Why does icsend require JavaScript?

icsend uses JavaScript to:

- Encrypt and decrypt files locally on the client instead of the server.
- Render the user interface.
- Manage translations on the website into various different languages.

Since icsend is an open source project, you can see all of the cool ways we use JavaScript by [examining our code](https://github.com/komachi/icsend/).
